                    <p>2014</p>
                    <p> During my time at the Pennsylvania State University, I focused on circuit design, antenna design, 
                        and RF amplifier design.  With specialties in analog and digital design as well as RF amplifier
                        design.  I enjoyed working in the lab with hardware including oscilloscopes, meters, and power supplies.
                        I am also familer with the proper operation of spectrum analyzers and anechoic chambers.  By using 
                        function generators to verify the proper operation of antennas in different environments.

                    <h3>Python Validation Software</h3>
                    <p>When tasked with improving the validation process at my employer.  I took the on the challenge
                        by breaking down the situation into bite size pieces.  This particular task required me to control
                        the temperature of the chamber, the pressure of the chamber, and the voltage on the device.  Doing 
                        so taught me the various techniques for communicating with different pieces of validation hardware.
                        For example the multimeter, power supply, pressure controller and temperature chamber.  Each of these 
                        devices required different commands to make sure they were controlled properly and at the approriate time.

                        I was able to break down the testing into simple steps.

                        <ol>
                            <li>Set temperature</li>
                            <li>Verify temperature</li>
                            <li>Measure temperature</li>
                            <li>Set pressure</li>
                            <li>Verify pressure</li>
                            <li>Measure pressure</li>
                            <li>Repeat for all temperatures</li>
                        </ol>

                        Using simple input questions I am able to use this validation software for any validation test plan that 
                        uses this equipment.

                        This software has reduced the validation test time from 2 weeks down to 2 days, increasing the efficiency by 700%

                    <h3>Improve Company Design for Manufacturing Process</h3>
                    <p> While beginning my career at my employer, I quickly notices the lack of structure around the 
                        process for designing new PCBA's.  This process did not take in to account any of the standards
                        located in the IPC standards.  These guidelines are used to make PCBA's manufacturable at multiple 
                        contract manufacturers.  This was leading to issues when changing suppliers for PCBAs when one
                        supplier did not have the capabilities that the previous supplier did.  By standardizing the design 
                        rules to be compatible with the IPC standards our PCB designs quickly became easier to manufacure, 
                        and cheaper.
